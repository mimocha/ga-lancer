# MATLAB-GA-Simulation

## Background:
This is a personal project based on the book (Japanese):

The main objective is to create a numerical vehicle simulation based in MATLAB,
then apply machine learning to an agent. (Genetic Algorithm was used in this case).

This simulation was done for the Robot Lancer competition 2018.  
Work was done between October 2017 - March 2018.  
Files are being revised and uploaded retroactively.

---
### Revision 0.03.3
Added *Maps* folder, containing all .mat files which contains MAP coordinates  
Created new folder, *Miscellany* to contain non-essential functions and scripts.  
*Last Changed: 1.31.2018*  
Added "gmap_view.m" into Miscellany  
*Originally "gmap_view.m"*  
*Personal Project - Completed: 12.18.2017*  
Moved Tensorflow files into Miscellany

*Notes: Evaluation_XXb.mat files contain two rows of coordinate, instead of four.*  
*This was implemented later, in the version VehicleSimulation_10f.m*

---
### Revision 0.03.2
Added Tensorflow python files  
*Originally "Neural Model.py" and "Neural Net Example.txt"*  
*Personal Project - Completed: 12.22.2017*

---
### Revision 0.03.1
Fixed Markdown styling in README.md for GitHub

---
### Revision 0.03
Merged "VehicleSimulation_10c.m" into main.m  
*Originally "VehicleSimulation_10c.m"*  
*Personal Project - Completed: 01.19.2018*

Overhauled algorithm for vehicle control.  
Changed GUI display information.  
Fixed Markdown styling in README.md, and added proper unicode encoding for book name.  
Added additional info for revision logs - *Original file name and completion date*

---
### Revision 0.02
Merged "VehicleSimulation_10b.m" into main.m  
*Originally "VehicleSimulation_10b.m"*  
*Personal Project - Completed: 12.15.2017*

Fixed major algorithmic problems, and added new documentations  
Changing README.md updating style - add new change logs to the top of list instead.  
New .gitignore for ignoring .asv

---
### Revision 0.01.1
Added some documentation to main.m, explaining variables and some calculations.  
Refer to the textbook for full explanation on the hows and whys.

---
### Revision 0.01
Added file "VehicleSimulation_10a.m" as "main.m"  
*Originally "VehicleSimulation_10a.m"*  
*Class Work - Completed: 11.24.2017*  
Final version from textbook -- based on example "mobile10demo.m"
