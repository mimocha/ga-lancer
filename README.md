# MATLAB-GA-Simulation

Background:
This is a personal project based on the book:
	"ロボットモデリング　ＭＡＴＬＡＢによるシミュレーションと開発"
	ISBN 978-4-274-20431-9
	
The main objective is to create a numerical vehicle simulation based in MATLAB, 
then apply machine learning to an agent. (Genetic Algorithm was used in this case).

This simulation was done for the Robot Lancer competition 2018.
Work was done between October 2017 - March 2018.
Files are being revised and uploaded retroactively.
