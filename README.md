# MATLAB-GA-Simulation

Background:
This is a personal project based on the book:
	"ãƒ­ãƒœãƒƒãƒˆãƒ¢ãƒ‡ãƒªãƒ³ã‚°ã€€ï¼­ï¼¡ï¼´ï¼¬ï¼¡ï¼¢ã?«ã‚ˆã‚‹ã‚·ãƒŸãƒ¥ãƒ¬ãƒ¼ã‚·ãƒ§ãƒ³ã?¨é–‹ç™º"
	ISBN 978-4-274-20431-9
	
The main objective is to create a numerical vehicle simulation based in MATLAB, 
then apply machine learning to an agent. (Genetic Algorithm was used in this case).

This simulation was done for the Robot Lancer competition 2018.
Work was done between October 2017 - March 2018.
Files are being revised and uploaded retroactively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revision 0.02.0

Merged "VehicleSimulation_10b.m" into main.m
Fixed major algorithmic problems, and added new documentations
Changing README.md updating style - add new change logs to the top of list instead.
New .gitignore for ignoring .asv

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revision 0.01.1

Added some documentation to main.m, explaining variables and some calculations.
Refer to the textbook for full explanation on the hows and whys.
